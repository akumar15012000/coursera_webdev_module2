        <p id="c1">Chicken</p>
        <br>
        Chicken originally referred to young domestic fowl.[13] The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of chicken survives in the phrase Hen and Chickens, sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).

        In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are referred to by the slang term yardbird.[14]

        <p id="c1">Beef</p>
        <br>
        Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25%
         of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[5]
         In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are
          the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, 
          the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef 
          or veal in the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.

          <p id="c1">Sushi</p>
          <br>
          Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known 
          as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly 
          months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling;[3] the rice
          would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of sushi became an important source 
          of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, 
          of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty,
           notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[7]
